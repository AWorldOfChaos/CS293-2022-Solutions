## Testcases
---
All the inputs and outputs have been added to the the testcases folder. The evaluation journey inputs are in the file adminEvalInputs.txt and to be used for all *five* testcases. The marks distribution across testcases is as follows:

Testcase 0: 1.5  
Testcase 1: 1.5  
Testcase 2: 2.0  
Testcase 3: 4.0  
Testcase 4: 4.0   

Missing correct journeys and printing incorrect journey is penalised appropriately.
